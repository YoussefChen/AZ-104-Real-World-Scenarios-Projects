Azure Administrator Portfolio - Youssef CHENNOUFI
Azure Administrator | Cloud Infrastructure Specialist | Automation Enthusiast
This portfolio demonstrates production-ready Azure administration skills through three enterprise-grade projects, showcasing identity management, storage solutions, and cost optimization capabilities.

Portfolio Overview
Three complete Azure projects demonstrating end-to-end implementation skills from architecture design through deployment, automation, and cost optimization. Each project solves real business problems and includes full documentation, automation scripts, and cost analysis.
Total Development Time: ~15-18 hours
Combined Cost Savings Demonstrated: €1,150+ monthly
Technologies: Azure DevTest Labs, Logic Apps, Azure Files, Storage Sync, Automation, PowerShell

Projects
1. Automated Employee Lifecycle Management
Problem Solved: Manual user provisioning takes 15-20 minutes per employee. Delayed offboarding creates security risks.
Solution: Serverless automation using Logic Apps and Azure Storage Tables that provisions new employees in 90 seconds and disables departing employees immediately.
Key Results:

 Provisioning time: 15 minutes → 90 seconds (90% faster)
 Monthly savings: €225 in IT labor
 Security: Immediate account disabling (zero delay)
 Success rate: 100% automation accuracy

Technologies: Microsoft Entra ID, Azure Logic Apps, Storage Tables, Office 365 Connectors
Skills Demonstrated: Identity & Access Management, Low-Code Automation, Integration Architecture, Security Compliance

2. Enterprise File Server Migration to Azure Files
Problem Solved: On-premises file servers cost €290/month, require maintenance, and lack disaster recovery.
Solution: Complete hybrid migration to Azure Files with sync, tiering, and automated backups while maintaining user experience.
Key Results:

 Cost reduction: 91% (€290 → €26/month)
 Storage optimization: 75% local storage saved via tiering
 RTO: <15 minutes with automated backups
 Enabled remote work: Cloud-accessible file shares

Technologies: Azure Files Premium, Azure File Sync, Recovery Services Vault, Storage Firewall, Lifecycle Management
Skills Demonstrated: Hybrid Cloud Architecture, Backup & DR Strategy, Network Security, Storage Optimization

3. Automated Dev/Test Environment with Cost Controls
Problem Solved: Developers wait 3 days for VMs. Forgotten VMs cost €3,000/month. No budget visibility.
Solution: Self-service DevTest Labs platform with auto-shutdown, custom images, and automated cleanup runbooks.
Key Results:

 VM provisioning: 3 days → Instant (100% improvement)
 Cost reduction: 63% (€980 → €360/month)
 Zero forgotten VMs: Automatic 7-day deletion
 IT tickets: 50/month → 0 (self-service)

Technologies: Azure DevTest Labs, Azure Automation, PowerShell Runbooks, Managed Identity, Cost Management
Skills Demonstrated: Infrastructure Governance, Cost Optimization, PowerShell Automation, DevOps Practices
