# Azure Administrator Portfolio - Youssef CHENNOUFI

**Azure Administrator | Cloud Infrastructure Specialist | Automation Enthusiast**

This portfolio demonstrates production-ready Azure administration skills through three enterprise-grade projects, showcasing identity management, storage solutions, and cost optimization capabilities.

---

## Portfolio Overview

Three complete Azure projects demonstrating end-to-end implementation skills from architecture design through deployment, automation, and cost optimization. Each project solves real business problems and includes full documentation, automation scripts, and cost analysis.

**Total Development Time:** ~15-18 hours  
**Combined Cost Savings Demonstrated:** €1,150+ monthly  
**Technologies:** Azure DevTest Labs, Logic Apps, Azure Files, Storage Sync, Automation, PowerShell

---

## Projects

### 1. Automated Employee Lifecycle Management
**Problem Solved:** Manual user provisioning takes 15-20 minutes per employee. Delayed offboarding creates security risks.

**Solution:** Serverless automation using Logic Apps and Azure Storage Tables that provisions new employees in 90 seconds and disables departing employees immediately.

**Key Results:**
-  Provisioning time: 15 minutes → 90 seconds (90% faster)
-  Monthly savings: €225 in IT labor
-  Security: Immediate account disabling (zero delay)
-  Success rate: 100% automation accuracy

**Technologies:** Microsoft Entra ID, Azure Logic Apps, Storage Tables, Office 365 Connectors

**Skills Demonstrated:** Identity & Access Management, Low-Code Automation, Integration Architecture, Security Compliance

### 2. Enterprise File Server Migration to Azure Files
**Problem Solved:** On-premises file servers cost €290/month, require maintenance, and lack disaster recovery.

**Solution:** Complete hybrid migration to Azure Files with sync, tiering, and automated backups while maintaining user experience.

**Key Results:**
-  Cost reduction: 91% (€290 → €26/month)
-  Storage optimization: 75% local storage saved via tiering
-  RTO: <15 minutes with automated backups
-  Enabled remote work: Cloud-accessible file shares

**Technologies:** Azure Files Premium, Azure File Sync, Recovery Services Vault, Storage Firewall, Lifecycle Management

**Skills Demonstrated:** Hybrid Cloud Architecture, Backup & DR Strategy, Network Security, Storage Optimization

### 3. Automated Dev/Test Environment with Cost Controls
**Problem Solved:** Developers wait 3 days for VMs. Forgotten VMs cost €3,000/month. No budget visibility.

**Solution:** Self-service DevTest Labs platform with auto-shutdown, custom images, and automated cleanup runbooks.

**Key Results:**
-  VM provisioning: 3 days → Instant (100% improvement)
-  Cost reduction: 63% (€980 → €360/month)
-  Zero forgotten VMs: Automatic 7-day deletion
-  IT tickets: 50/month → 0 (self-service)

**Technologies:** Azure DevTest Labs, Azure Automation, PowerShell Runbooks, Managed Identity, Cost Management

**Skills Demonstrated:** Infrastructure Governance, Cost Optimization, PowerShell Automation, DevOps Practices
